## About:
* This repository is the collection of AI Idea implementation and research.
* This repository also contains small-scale to large-scale projects that are related to AI, ML, RL, and Wavelet Transformation.

## How to navigate through this repository:
* You can find the implementation of AI idea in the [AI-Idea](./AI-Idea/) folder. This folder contains the JAVA and Python implementation of fundamental idea in AI field, considering supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement leanring:
  * [Approach-n](./AI-Idea/approach-n/)
  * [BayesianNetwork](./AI-Idea/BayesianNetwork/) 
  * [Clue-reasoning-game](./AI-Idea/Clue-reasoning-game/)
  * [Clustering](./AI-Idea/Clustering/)
  * [cs371-bandit-connect4](./AI-Idea/cs371-bandit-connect4/)
  * [Game Tree Lab](./AI-Idea/Game%20Tree%20Lab/)
  * [informed-search](./AI-Idea/informed-search/)
  * [MarkovDecisionProcess](./AI-Idea/MarkovDecisionProcess/)
  * [Stochastic Local Search Lab](./AI-Idea/Stochastic%20Local%20Search%20Lab/)
  * [uninformed-search](./AI-Idea/uninformed-search/)
  * [value-iteration](./AI-Idea/value-iteration/)

* You can also find the implementation of projects that are implemented in Java and Python in the [projects](./projects/) folder. This folder contains projects that are in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)'s competitions, Ebay's ML Competition, personal researches, and in-class AI projects:
  * [fake-new](./projects/fake_new/)
  * [frozen-lake](./projects/frozen-lake/)
  * [roshambo](./projects/roshambo/)
  * [snake-game](./projects/snake-game/)
  * [virtual-try-on](./projects/virtual-try-on/)
  * [wavelet_transformation](./projects/wavelet_transformation/)

* In each of those folder, there will be a `README.md` file that guides you through the project.
